# Alzheimer's Classification with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project is a deep learning-based solution for classifying Alzheimer's disease based on medical images. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze brain scans and classify them into one of four categories: Mild Demented, Moderate Demented, Non-Demented, or Very Mild Demented.

## Features

- Deep Learning Model: The project uses a custom CNN model built with TensorFlow and Keras to perform image classification.

- Web Application: The classification model is deployed as a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload medical images for Alzheimer's classification.

- Data Preprocessing: Image data is preprocessed to ensure it's compatible with the model, including resizing and normalization.

- Model Training: The CNN model is trained on a labeled dataset to learn and make accurate predictions.
